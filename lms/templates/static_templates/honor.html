	      <p>When you register to use iBiology Courses, you agree to rely on your own work when completing assessments, homework,
		      problems, and other course material, unless working with other students or your mentors is part of the task. You agree to
		      acknowledge all external sources when appropriate, and refrain from trying to improve your results via dishonest or fradulent means.
		      This Honor Code is not meant to stifle discussion within and outside of any course. While you should submit work that is your own,
		      we encourage you to generate knowledge by discussing course material with your peers and mentors.
